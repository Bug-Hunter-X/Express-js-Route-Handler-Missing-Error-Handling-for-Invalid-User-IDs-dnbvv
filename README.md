# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User IDs

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: missing error handling for invalid user IDs.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

## Problem

The original code lacks proper validation and error handling for the `userId` parameter. This can lead to several issues:

* **Unexpected behavior:**  If an invalid ID is provided (e.g., a string or a negative number), the application may crash or produce incorrect results.
* **Security vulnerabilities:**  Poorly validated input could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access or cause denial-of-service attacks.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates how to add robust error handling.  It includes:

* **Input validation:** Check that the `userId` is a valid number.
* **Error handling:**  Return an appropriate HTTP error code (e.g., 400 Bad Request) if the `userId` is invalid.
* **Graceful handling of missing parameters:** Respond appropriately if the `userId` parameter is missing.
